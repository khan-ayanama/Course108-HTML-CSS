# ID Selector

## Basic ID Selector

Selects an element with a specific ID.

```css
    #my-element {
    /* CSS styles here */
    }
```

This selects the element with the ID "my-element" and applies the specified styles.

## Multiple ID Selector

Although it's not recommended, you can combine multiple ID selectors. However, this is generally not a good practice, as IDs should be unique within a page.

```css
    #element1#element2 {
    /* CSS styles here */
    }
```

This would select elements with both "element1" and "element2" IDs if they exist.

## ID Selector in Combination with Element Selector

Selects a specific type of element with a particular ID.

```css
    h2#section-title {
    /* CSS styles here */
    }
```

This selects an `<h2>`element with the ID "section-title" and applies the specified styles.

## ID Selector with Pseudo-class

Combines an ID selector with a pseudo-class to select elements based on their state or position.

```css
    #my-button:hover {
    /* CSS styles here */
    }
```

This selects the element with the ID "my-button" when the mouse hovers over it.

## ID Selector with Attribute Selector

Combines an ID selector with an attribute selector to select elements with a specific ID and a certain attribute.

```css
    #user[disabled] {
    /* CSS styles here */
    }
```

This selects the element with the ID "user" that also has a "disabled" attribute.

## ID Selector with Attribute Value Matching

Combines an ID selector with an attribute selector that matches a specific attribute value.

```css
    #profile-image[src$=".jpg"] {
    /* CSS styles here */
    }
```

This selects the element with the ID "profile-image" and a src attribute whose value ends with ".jpg."
